Nothing more than a project I started when I was just 14 years of age.  I felt like learning some Visual Basic, so I decided to make a keylogger.  The basic key-recognition portion of the program came from YouTube tutorials (thank you).  From there, I kept building up.  Now, I have designed a keylogger capable of running completely hidden, tracking all keystrokes, automatically saving the recorded keystrokes to a text file, and having password protection so that only a specified password can bring it back to full view, when entered into a text field and copied.  I have used it on my own computer to steal several youtube, facebook, and email passwords, and they have no clue that I did it.

I am making this open-source (to a select few) so that I can have multiple persons to assist me, and because I'm too lazy to do this all on my own.


Upcoming features in the keylogger:
Screen shot capabilities so that you can actually SEE what people are doing.
More hiding abilities, since it shows up in the task manager under the processes tab, which noobs don't ever use.
Ability to startup when someone logs in so that it doesn't have to be manually activated.
Ability to open up the internet browser so they can view my website if they have questions (it currently opens a preset IE-like browser, but it is slow, and people should be able to view web pages in their default browser.)
